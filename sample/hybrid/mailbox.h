Replacement for mailbox.h of hello_fft.
This version of the file switches to the vcio2 driver when available
that does not require root access.
Otherwise the old vcio driver is used. In this case you need to run as root.
Remember to change the call to mapmem and pass the additional file_desc parameter.
