    <h2>Use the GPU with vcio2</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <tt>/dev/vcio2</tt> with <a href="APIref.html#open"><tt>open</tt></a> in read/write mode.</li>
      <li>Allocate an appropriate amount of GPU memory with <a href="APIref.html#mmap0"><tt>mmap</tt></a>.</li>
      <li>Place the shader code, the uniforms and the control blocks into the allocated GPU memory. Don't forget that the GPU only
        accepts bus addresses and cannot access the applications memory.<br>
        <small>Although the GPU can access all physical memory there is no reasonable way to use application memory directly, since
          it may be fragmented in physical memory and the GPU cannot use scatter gather lists.</small></li>
      <li>Run your code on the GPU with <a href="APIref.html#IOCTL_EXEC_QPU"><tt>IOCTL_EXEC_QPU</tt></a>.<br>
        Use an appropriate timeout. This will recover from GPU crashes in most cases.</li>
      <li>Repeat the last two steps as needed.</li>
      <li>Close the device when you don't need it anymore. This releases all GPU memory allocated by this handle.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>See <a href="#sample">sample program</a> for further details.</p>
    <p>See also <a href="http://www.maazl.de/project/vc4asm/doc/">vc4asm</a> for a powerful and free QPU macro assembler.</p>
    <h2><a id="migrate" name="migrate"></a>Migrating from hello_fft style mailbox</h2>
    <p>If you have an application that uses the old vcio driver, e.g. hello_fft, you need to do the following steps to migrate to
      vcio2:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Copy <tt>include/soc/bcm2835/vcio2.h</tt></b> to your source files.</li>
      <li><b>Replace</b> the files <b><tt>mailbox.h</tt> and <tt>mailbox.c</tt></b> with the ones from the <tt>sample/porting</tt>
        or <tt>sample/hybrid</tt> directory depending on whether you want to run on installations without the vcio2 driver as well.</li>
      <li><b>Adjust include path of <tt>vcio2.h</tt></b> in <tt>mailbox.c</tt>.</li>
      <li><b>Add an additional first parameter</b> with the device handle returned from <tt>mbox_open</tt> <b>to any call to <tt>mapmem</tt></b>.</li>
      <li><b>Compile and run</b>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now you application should use the new kernel driver it does no longer require root privileges to run if you grant access to
      <tt>/dev/vcio2</tt>.</p>
    <p>Some applications (including <tt>hello_fft</tt>) <b>access the Videocore IV control registers directly</b> for faster
      access. <em>This is not supported by vcio2</em> and it will never be. It is strongly recommended not to do so because this
      raises <i>serious race conditions</i> in multitasking environment. You need to refactor the code to always use the vcio2
      driver for GPU access.</p>
    <h2><a id="concurrent" name="concurrent"></a>Using vcio2 concurrently</h2>
    <p>The vcio2 device may be opened as often as you like. The only limiting factor is the amount of GPU memory available.</p>
    <p>Calls to<tt> <a href="APIref.html#IOCTL_EXEC_QPU">IOCTL_EXEC_QPU</a></tt> are strictly serialized. So no two applications
      can run code on the GPU simultaneously. However, they can run code alternately.</p>
    <p><em>You should not use the <tt>/dev/vcio</tt> device or a character device of the built-in vcio driver concurrently to <tt>/dev/vcio2</tt>.</em>
      The calls to this devices are not understood by vcio2 and may seriously interfere with <tt>/dev/vcio2</tt> access. E.g. the
      application using <tt>/dev/vcio</tt> might disable the power of the GPU while another application is running GPU code. Future
      versions of vcio2 might lock the other devices while <tt>/dev/vcio2</tt> is open at least once.<br>
      This restriction does not apply to calls that are independent, e.g. reading the GPU memory size or even GPU memory
      allocations. The vcio2 driver and the vcio driver share a common mutex for this purpose. Only indirect dependencies are not
      tracked.</p>
    <h3>Performance counters</h3>
    <p>vcio2 manages access to the V3D performance counters for all device users. There is however no way to synchronize access to
      the hardware registers with other applications or drivers that access these counters. I.e. as soon as any application enables
      performance counters via<tt> <a href="APIref.html#IOCTL_SET_V3D_PERF_COUNT">IOCTL_SET_V3D_PERF_COUNT</a></tt> no other way to
      access these counters must be used unless the feature is disabled again.</p>
    <p>There are no more restrictions that I know of.</p>
    <h2><a id="sample" name="sample"></a>Sample application</h2>
    <p>In the sample folder there is a simple sample application that utilizes the vcio2 device in different variants, each in its
      own folder. It does some stupid computations by applying all available QPU operators to a bunch of constants.</p>
    <h3>Variants</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt><b>native</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>This is the simplest way to use the vcio2 driver. This is <em>recommended for new developments</em> that depend on vcio2.</dd>
      <dt><tt><b>porting</b></tt> </dt>
      <dd>
        <div>This is the sample application that uses an API closely to the mailbox API of hello_fft. It only routes the method
          calls to the corresponding IOCTLs of vcio2.</div>
      </dd>
      <dt> <tt><b>hybrid</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>This implementation first checks whether <tt>/dev/vcio2</tt> is available. If it is present the behavior is the same than
        variant 'porting'. But if not then the code falls back to the builtin <tt>/dev/vcio</tt> driver.<br>
        You should use this pattern only if you want to ensure that your application does not strictly depend on vcio2. But there
        are several drawbacks. First of all, without vcio2 the application always requires root privileges.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>How to build and run</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter one of the sample directories.</li>
      <li>Type <tt>make</tt></li>
      <li>Run <tt>./smitest</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now the test application should print some pages of results to the console. Of course, you need to <a href="index.html#install">install
        the vcio2 driver</a> before. In case you have chosen the <tt>hybrid</tt> directory the application may run without the
      vcio2 driver installed as well. But you must run it as root in this case.</p>
